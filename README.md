# WebSML2

WebSML2 is an application which allows you to run SML from your web browser. 

It is still a work in progress, so things might break. You can check out the demo at [http://tkw1536.github.io/WebSML2](http://tkw1536.github.io/WebSML2). 

It is heavily based on SMLtoJS and the SMLtoJS_prompt. 

It uses the following libraries: 

* [SMLtoJs](http://www.smlserver.org/smltojs/) 4.3.5, licensed under MIT / GPLv2
* [smlObfuscator](https://github.com/kpj/smlObfuscator)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) 1.10.2, licensed under MIT
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) 1.10.3, licensed under MIT
* [jquery.nicescroll](http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll) 3.5.1, licensed under MIT

# TODO

* make a copy / save system
* make tests in browsers and add a supported browsers page
